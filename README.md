Axel is an open source HTTP/FTP multi connection download manager. It can use multiple mirrors for a download. Axel has no dependencies and is lightweight, so it might be useful as a wget clone on byte-critical systems.

This program done by Hossein Mobasher (hoseinmobasher@gmail.com). I am using jni to access Axel C source code on Android Java.

Be a programmer! :)
